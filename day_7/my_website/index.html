    <div id="travel">
      <p>Ever since I graduated high school, I've been saving up for various trips abroad, both solo and with friends.
        Mostly I've explored Central America, South America, Europe and also the Caribbean. I've taken breaks from college
        and have moved an exhausting amount of times, sold cars and all my stuff in order to fund it. Over the years, I have
        taken on various gigs from teaching English to Chinese children online to delivering to-go food orders for supplemental
        income for travel.
      <p>In 2017, I decided to quit my job (which I ended up starting again as a contract worker) to live abroad, which had been
        a dream of mine since childhood. My boyfriend and I moved to northern Spain where I worked remote for a PR agency based in
        Boulder and also taught English to young children at a local academy. This time in San Sebastian was really pivotal for me.
        Living as a stranger in a new place was so exciting. Everything was intriguing and mysterious. I met people and started getting
        in the daily groove and began to realize despite completely different customs and traditions, it's all fundamentally relatable no
        matter where you go.</p>
